        description: 'We have used Eric Nelson Plumbing for all of our plumbing work since we moved to Minneapolis 7 years ago. Their work has been uniformly great. This time we had the remaining galvanized pipe replaced. Jaron & Nick straightened and simplified what had been a mess of pipes. We appreciate the attention to detail they gave to this project. Highly recommend ENP!',

        description: 'I called for a gas line repair and they came within the hour and completed the work very quickly. They bill time and materials, but the estimate was exactly what I ended up paying. The crew was professional, clearly explained the work that was done, and answered all my questions. Highly recommend!',
